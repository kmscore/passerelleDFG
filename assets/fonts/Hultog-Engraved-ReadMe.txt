HULTOG ENGRAVED
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

This is a clawed-in-clay-bricks interpretation of one of my own favorite fonts, Hultog. I designed this font to play nicely with my other “engraved” fonts (especially Temphis Engraven, but also Regal Demise), with the same rough-hewn look and – since I’ll be using them on the same page together – the same direction for the source of light. It’s scaled the same as Hultog itself, of course, but I didn’t bother cloning the metrics. Hultog Engraved is a full-keyboard set, freeware for personal use. Enjoy!
