Holstein ©1997 Fonthead Design

What is Holstein?
This is a cool font that is very readable but on the grungy side. There are
no serifs, so the font looks smooth. It has a lot of uses! Also check out the
heavier version, Holstein Bold.

Is it shareware?
No! This is FREEWARE! Use it to your hearts content without any guilt.
